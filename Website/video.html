        <h2>Movie Makers</h2>
        <p>
            At Disney videography is huge and has been used for decades and will continue to be used in our production for years. 
            It is the basis of filmmaking and storytelling. Videography can be found in countless Disney Movies and shows that involve 
            human characters or a real life setting. In areas where animation may not want to be used or can't be used, videography is 
            used to capture and create Disney films and shows from Star Wars to Marvel.
            Understanding what it takes to produce a great piece of video media will be a great foundation helping your kid grow their 
            artistic and creative abilities along with having the basic tools to create successful imagery using a camera will only boost 
            their skills towards becoming successful artists of film production.

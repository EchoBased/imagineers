        <p>
            Disney’s creation wouldn’t be possible without the programmers that make our tools, apps, and websites. 
            These truly smart and creative minds build the tools that help us tell our stories. That’s why we want to 
            foster the next generation of programmers to help us create better tools to enhance our other creators. 
            With this introductory module Imagineers will learn to appreciate the developers that create the tools of creation. 
            With knowledgeable instructors, that we hear run on Java, students will learn the basic concepts of successful programmers.

            Imagineers will use Visual studios to create basic programs and websites like this. By getting a sample of markup languages 
            such as HTML5, CSS, and then functional languages such as Python and JavaScript students will walk away with a foundational 
            understanding of syntax and good programming methods. Imagineers will also learn and hear from developers we have on staff 
            to learn the necessity of teamwork and how the development cycle works. By the end of the module Imagineers will have a solid 
            launching pad to pursue a career in programing.

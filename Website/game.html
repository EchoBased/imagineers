        <h2>The future of storys</h2>
        <p>
            Here at Disney we believe in pushing the envolope on new forms of story telling.
            Video games are a fun and interactive way to share your creativity with audiences of all ages.
            From the heart warming stories in the Kingdom Hearts series to the grity heroism in Star Wars 
            BattleFront, Disney seeks to tell more imersive stories through this medium. Imagineers will learn 
            how to build these imersive worlds while engaging in critical thinking and asset managment to create
            simple games for all to enjoy.

        <h2>Tools of the trade</h2>
        <p>
            Through our partnership with EA Imagineers will learn how to use the most widely used game engine Frosbite.
            Here they will develope basic programing skills and how to apply thier assets from past sections of the course.
            Imagineers will have to work as teams to piece together thier ideas and through this section we hope to inspire 
            them to learn not just critical thinking but also further develope there interpersonal skills as well. Here at Disney 
            team work is part of the magic!

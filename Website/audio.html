        <p>
            From live action to animation, sound design is key to creating the Disney magic audiences world wide enjoy.
            Sound design is the practice of using sound to create a variety of needs used in production. It is used to 
            enhance the mood, atmosphere, and tone of a production. It can consist of dialogue, SFX, music, and more. 
            Sound design is a crucial component of helping to make a production feel alive and bring weight to the storytelling.

        <h2>Tools of the trade</h2>
        <p>
            Imagineers will learn to utilize Adobe Audition, a sound design tool, to mix, create, 
            and edit audio content that can be partnered with the other skills that they will learn. 
            They will learn skills from basic understanding of how the audio files work, the layout, 
            splitting and joining audio files; to harder skills such as creating their own 
            sound effects and music to accompany their production, and working with animation to make 
            sure they can properly match audio to video. Along with learning skills, we have special lecture given by  
            our leading audio engineers to truely appreciate the weight audio has in our stories.

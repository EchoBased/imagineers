        <h2>Imaging Masters</h2>
        <p>
            Here at Disney animation sketching and photographic art has been the bedrock of sotry telling.
            With the development of technology our creative teams have only gotten better! With this part
            of the course we hope to spark the talent of future photographers and animators.

        <h2>Tools of the trade</h2>
        <p>
            Photoshop is a graphics editor where you can manipulate a certain graphic or image on a x and y plane. 
            Photo editing software like Photoshop allows a user to manipulate the image, change dimensions, quality, 
            and edit things out. Animators can use layers and tools in photoshop for animation. They can also use it 
            to make an image and use third party animation tools. This depends on what their goal is, if itâ€™s 2D, 3D, 
            or something like stop motion animation. There is multiple software made by Adobe to help with your animation 
            (Adobe Animate, vector animations rather than pixel-controlled animation) but for the camp we will focus on 
            making animations with only photoshop.
